## Messy - CHC-based solver for Semantics-Guided Synthesis

This repository contains `Messy`, a Semgus problem solver based on the CHC-based reduction described in the paper [Semantics-Guided Synthesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3434311). This is a new version of the solver intended to interface with the current standard [Semgus format](https://semgus-git.github.io/Semgus-Site/res/semgus-lang.pdf); those looking for the artifact should consult [this](https://dl.acm.org/do/10.1145/3410258/abs/) instead.

For more information on Semgus, please consult [this](https://semgus.org).

### Dependencies

```
scala, java (>= 1.8), z3, Semgus-Parser
```

`Messy` also has dependencies on external libraries such as Scallop and SemgusJava. This should not be a concern if you are running Messy within sbt, or through the provided fat JAR.

### Running Messy

To run Messy, download the fat JAR from the releases page, and run:
```
scala Messy.jar -i <PATH-TO-INPUT-SEMGUS-FILE>
```
This will produce an SMT file `out.z3`, upon which an external CHC solver (such as Z3) can be run.

The input to Messy should not be a raw SemGuS file, but a SemGuS file parsed to the JSON representation. For this, we recommend the parser hosted at (https://github.com/SemGuS-git/Semgus-Parser).

### Flags

`--infile, -i`: Input Semgus file to solve.

`--outfile, -o`: Output SMT file. Defaults to `out.z3`.

### Installation

If you wish to tweak with Messy directly, you should first install `sbt` and clone the repo. After that, 
run `sbt assembly` to produce the fat JAR on the releases page, or `sbt run` to run Messy directly from within `sbt`.

### Caveats

- Messy will currently treat the first variable supplied to a relation as the variable that represents the term, and thus can only solve Semgus problems that have been written to respect this fact. This is not required in general of Semgus files, and the restriction is expected to be lifted in the future; the current restriction is due to a discrepancy with the Semgus parser.

- Messy is currently unable to produce synthesized programs for realizable synthesis problems (even if it can prove that the generated CHC file is `sat`). This is because support for recursive datatypes and non-linear CHCs in `z3` is still highly experimental and will often crash when asked for proof witnesses, from which an actual program can be extracted.
- Messy currently does not support the list / array encoding described in the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3434311), and encodes syntactic representations of terms using algebraic datatypes. This functionality is expected to be added in the future.
